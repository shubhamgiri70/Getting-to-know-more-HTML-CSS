          <h1>ExplainSpeaking: Did India lose the World Cup because of the law of averages?</h1>
          <p>As the Indian cricket team’s unprecedented dominant run came to a tame end on Sunday evening, many commentators — followers and detractors alike — blamed the result on the “law of averages”. In fact, as India approached the last few matches in the league stage, many had claimed that it may be a good thing if India lost a match at that stage instead of entering the knock-outs (which involved just two matches — the semi-final and the final) undefeated.</p>
          <p>OpinionUpdated: November 22, 2023 10:38 am IST. I may or may not have unleashed the drunk sailor in me on Sunday. I'm not proud of it but blame it on my accident of birth. I'm an Indian and I cannot keep calm. Especially when there is a cricket match on. World Cup (men's) finals at that. Let me admit, I may be the problem. And everyone like me is part of the problem India seems to be grappling with for decades, or even centuries.</p>

                <h1>World Cup 2023: Breaking 1.4bn Indian hearts, Australia win final to become six-time world champions</h1>
                <p>Breaking the hearts of over 1.4 billion Indians, Australia romped to a six-wicket victory against India in front of a stunned 130,000 home fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday (Nov 19) evening. The win sealed a sixth World Cup trophy for the Australians who cemented their status as the most dominant team the sport has ever seen. 
                   Travis Head (137) played the innings of his lifetime by smashing an eloquent century while his partner Marnus Labuschagne (58*) did well to soak the pressure and perform the sheet-anchor job to perfection. Their super partnership meant that India never got a sniff of a comeback as the team from Down Under won the match with 42 balls to spare with Glenn Maxwell hitting the winning runs. </p>
                   <p>Chasing a sub-par total of 241, Australia were off to a shaky start as India knocked back three wickets in the first powerplay. Opener David Warner, who was dropped in the first over as the ball went between Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill in the slip cordon, could not capitalise and fell prey to Mohammed Shami.</p>
                   <p>Skipper Rohit Sharma brought Shami to share the opening ball duties, despite the latter having bowled as a first-change bowler in every match he had played. Despite the wicket, Shami had little control over the new ball as he bowled wayward lines, making the job difficult for wicketkeeper KL Rahul. 
                     On the other end, Jasprit Bumrah struck in consecutive overs, sending Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith back to the pavilion. Smith was particularly unlucky as replays showed that the ball impact was outside the line when he was adjudged LBW.</p>
